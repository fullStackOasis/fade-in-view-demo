# Fade in animation

This Android Studio project demonstrates how to animate layout changes using a transition.

Code is Java.

The app uses an Activity that hosts a single Fragment. The animation occurs in the Fragment.

[You can view a video that demos the behavior on YouTube](https://youtu.be/C3sljO0zgec).
